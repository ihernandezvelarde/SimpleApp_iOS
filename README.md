This is a simple application that contains [Kimetsu No Yaiba](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimetsu_no_Yaiba) characters and their information.

* On top of the main screen you will find an app bar with the title of the application followed by a table view where the different characters will appear with an image and a short description.

* You can access the complete information of the character pressing on each of them. This will take you to detail view in which you will see an image, base data and  a button that takes you to his wikipedia information page.

* In the bottom of the scree you will find a bottom bar with two options. One of them returns you to the main screen, the other will show you a new screen with the application creator information and a button to access on his GitHub.

* Here you can see the wire frame of the app:
